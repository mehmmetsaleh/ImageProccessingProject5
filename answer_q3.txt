when we use more res blocks the performance becomes better and MSE gets lower.
so a model with greater number of res blocks seems to perform better than a model with less res blocks.
MSE tends to decrease as the number of epochs increase. 
both the increased number of epochs and the res blocks yield better performance of the model overall.
